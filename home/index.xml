      <description>Biography Iâ€™m a postdoctoral research scientist in the Zhang Lab at the Department of Systems Biology, the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, and the Motor Neuron Center at Columbia University Medical Center. My primary research interests are understanding RNA biology using bioinformatics and machining learning methods in development and disease context. I currently focus on studying the mechanisms of RNA splicing and its regulation in neuronal subtype specification by integrating multiple types of high throughput sequencing data such as RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq.</description>
